test.php is for checking your browser viewport size.  
I will put comments in the code when i feel like it.  

Version 1.1
	Main differences from Version 1.0 gdrive version:  
	more advanced and sohai version of authCheck.php  
	senarai now lists out both peserta and hakim instead of only peserta  
	Admin can edit/delete peserta's and hakim's info  
	messages are now jscipt alerts instead of just html words cuz tch wants it  
	some optimization that might not even do anything  
	more organized spacing in code  
	more uniformed css code  
  
Version 1.2
	semak.php now also displays alert msg instead of html words
	kemaskini.php now updates info individually so u can fill in ur name only instead of filling in everything agn
