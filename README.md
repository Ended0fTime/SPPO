test.php is for checking your browser viewport size.  
I will put comments in the code when i feel like it.  

Main differences from gdrive version:  
  more advanced and sohai version of authCheck.php  
  senarai now lists out both peserta and hakim instead of only peserta  
  Admin can edit/delete peserta's and hakim's info  
  some optimization that might not even do anything  
  messages are now jscipt alerts instead of just html words cuz tch wants it  
  more organized spacing in code  
  more uniformed css code
